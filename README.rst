errortools
=======

*errortools* is a set of Python tools that facilitate the computation
of uncertainty estimates on predictions made by common (machine learning) algorithms.

*errortools* is a new initiative (start in March 2019) and will be gradually built out.
Currently fitting, predicting with, and estimating uncertainties on a logistic regression
classifier is being developed, as well as an interface with PyTorch for estimating
uncertainties on neural network predictions.

* Code: https://github.com/faab5/errortools

The notebooks folder contains examples on the usage.
